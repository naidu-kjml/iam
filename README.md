## Usage

This project uses some of our own custom Go packages. If you encounter issues please consult <https://gitlab.skypicker.com/go/packages#usage>.

Create `.env.yaml` file and set environment variables. Check `.env-sample.yaml`
to see all the possible variables.

To install dependencies and start the project, make sure your GOPATH is set,
and run:

```
make
make start
```

You can use `make dev` on development to reload the server automatically on file
changes.

# Redis

To run this project you need to have redis installed and running, you can use
the following commands to do so.

```shell
# MacOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Linux
# install using your package manager
systemctl start redis

# Docker
docker run -it --rm -p 6379:6379 redis
```

You can use `redis-cli` to interact with redis (ie. check keys and values).
Useful commands:

```shell
# Show all keys
KEYS *

# Show value for a key
GET <key>
```

# Secret Manager

This service uses Vault for syncing secrets to our app. The base path is `secret/governant`.

The following structure is expected:

- `secret/governant/{environment}/app_tokens`
- `secret/governant/{environment}/settings`
