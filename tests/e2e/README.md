# End to End tests

These tests create the Kiwi IAM service and required services (Okta nginx, Redis) and runs tests against it to guarantee that our service is running correctly.

## Running locally

When running locally it is important to first set up environment variables in your shell.

```sh
export GITLAB_USERNAME=tester@kiwi.com
export GITLAB_PASSWORD=your-access-token-from-gitlab
make e2e
```

If you didn't make changes on IAM or mocks (eg. you only created e2e tests) you
can run `make e2e/nobuild` which will skip the image builds.

Both `make e2e` and `make e2e/nobuild` start a test environment using
docker-compose, to tear down this environment run `e2e/env-stop`.
